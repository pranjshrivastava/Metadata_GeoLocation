<h3>Image Viewer and Metadata Extractor</h3>
<h1>Description: </h1>
This project is an image viewer and metadata extractor application built using PyQt, a set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework. The application allows users to view geo-tagged images, navigate through them, and extract metadata information such as latitude and longitude.

<h1>Features</h1>
<h1>Real-Time Image Display:</h1>

View geo-tagged images in real-time as they are added to a specified directory.
Navigate through images using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
Interrupt and resume the automatic flow of image display.


<h1>Metadata Extraction:</h1>

Click on any point in an image to extract metadata, including the latitude and longitude of the image's center.
Calculate the latitude and longitude of the pixel clicked by the user.
